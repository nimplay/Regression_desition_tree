House Price Prediction with Decision Tree Regression
Streamlit
Python
Scikit-Learn

This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that uses a Decision Tree Regression model to predict house prices based on the size (in square feet) and the number of bedrooms. Additionally, it allows users to upload a custom CSV file to train the model and visualize data insights through interactive charts.

Key Features
Price Prediction: Enter the size of the house and the number of bedrooms to get a price prediction.

Data Upload: Upload your own CSV file to train the model with new data.

Data Visualization: Explore interactive charts to understand data distribution and relationships between features.

Easy Deployment: The app can be deployed on Streamlit Sharing with just a few clicks.

Requirements
To run this project, you need:

Python 3.8 or higher.

Libraries specified in requirements.txt.

Installation
Clone this repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
cd house-price-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):


python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Install the dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Running Locally
Activate the virtual environment (if you created one):


source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
Run the app:


streamlit run app.py
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501.

How to Use the App
Upload Data:

In the sidebar, upload a CSV file with columns Size, Bedrooms, and Price.

If no file is uploaded, the app will use a default dataset.

Visualize Data:

Explore the automatically generated charts:

Price Distribution: A histogram showing the distribution of house prices.

Size vs. Price: A scatter plot showing how house size affects price.

Bedrooms vs. Price: A box plot showing how the number of bedrooms affects price.

Train the Model:

If you uploaded a CSV file, click "Train Model with New Data" to update the model.

Predict Prices:

Enter the size of the house and the number of bedrooms.

Click "Predict Price" to get the prediction.

Deploying to Streamlit Sharing
Upload the project to a GitHub repository.

Go to Streamlit Sharing and sign up with your GitHub account.

Click "New App" and fill in the details:

Select the repository and branch.

Specify the main file (app.py).

Click "Deploy". Streamlit will handle the rest.

Once deployed, the app will be available at a public link.
